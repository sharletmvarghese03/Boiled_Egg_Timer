# Boiled_Egg_Timer
Boiled Egg Timer is a single page app that assist the user to keep track of cooking time required for boiling an egg. Depending on user's preference he can choose among 3 available options: Soft, Medium or Hard

We have set-up timer for each category of Boiled Egg. When time would be up, alarm will be ringing to notify the user.

In this project I have used AVFoundation Library and AVAudioPlayer to play alarm sound.
